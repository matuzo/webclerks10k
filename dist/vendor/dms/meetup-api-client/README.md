=========================

This is a client for the Meetup.com API powered by the Guzzle Project.

## Installation

The library is available through Composer, so its easy to get it. Just Run this:

    composer require dms/meetup-api-client

## Features

* All documented and non-deprecated methods from:
    * Meetup API v3
    * Meetup API v2
    * Legacy v1, except methods tagged as deprecated
* Key authentication
* OAuth 1.0 Authentication
* POST, GET and DELETE methods

## Usage

To use the API Client simply instantiate the preferred client (key auth or OAuth), giving it the correct parameters

```php
<?php

// Key Authentication
$client = MeetupKeyAuthClient::factory(array('key' => 'my-meetup-key'));

// OAuth Authentication
$config = array(
    'consumer_key'    => 'consumer-key',
    'consumer_secret' => '*****',
    'token'           => '*****',
    'token_secret'    => '*****',
);
$client = MeetupOAuthClient::factory($config);
```

Invoke Commands using our `__call` method (auto-complete phpDocs are included)

```php
<?php

$client = MeetupKeyAuthClient::factory(array('key' => 'my-meetup-key'));

// Use our __call method (auto-complete provided)
$response = $client->getRsvps(array('event_id' => 'the-event-id'));

foreach ($response as $responseItem) {
    echo $responseItem['member']['name'] . PHP_EOL;
}
```
Or Use the `getCommand` method:

```php
<?php

$client = MeetupKeyAuthClient::factory(array('key' => 'my-meetup-key'));

//Retrieve the Command from Guzzle
$command = $client->getCommand('GetRsvps', array('event_id' => 'the-event-id'));
$command->prepare();

$response = $command->execute();

foreach ($response as $responseItem) {
    echo $responseItem['member']['name'] . PHP_EOL;
}
```

For a list of all the available commands, see the [Meetup API documentation on ReadTheDocs](http://meetup-api.readthedocs.org/en/latest/meetup_api.html#api-client-method-index)

## Response

This wrapper implements two types of custom responses to facilitate the usage of the results directly.

### Response for Collection

When querying for collections the client wraps the result in a `MultiResultResponse`. This response implements a `Iterator` allowing you to directly iterate over the results, while still giving you access to all response data, as well as the metadata returned by the API using the `getMetaData()` method.

```php
<?php

$rsvps = $client->getRsvps(array('event_id' => 'the-event-id'));

foreach ($rsvps as $rsvp) {
    echo $rsvp['member']['name'] . PHP_EOL;
}

$metadata = $response->getMetaData();
echo "Debug Url:" . $metadata['url'];
```

### Response for Single Resource

When getting information of a single resource the client will wrap that in a `SingleResultResponse`. This response gives you direct array access to results, but retains response data so you can still access it.

```php
<?php

$rsvp = $client->getRsvp(array('id' => 'rsvp-id'));

echo "RSVP? " . $rsvp['response'];

echo "StatusCode: " . $rsvp->getStatusCode();
```

## Rate Limiting

A rate limiter is included in this client, its **enabled by default**, but can be disabled as described below. It uses a pre-defined factor (50% by default) to determine when it should start throttling the calls, by using a sleep slowdown. Operations are based on the `X-RateLimit-*` headers, to determine remaining limits and reset times.

### Configuring Rate Limit Kick-in Factor

To configure how late the back algorithm kicks in, you can set a custom rate factor:

```php
<?php

$client = MeetupKeyAuthClient::factory(array(
    'key' => 'my-meetup-key',
    'rate_limit_factor' => 0.75
));

```

### Disabling Rate Limiting

If you do not wish to use Rate Limiting and deal with errors sent by the API yourself, use the config below.

```php
<?php

$client = MeetupKeyAuthClient::factory(array(
    'key' => 'my-meetup-key',
    'disable_rate_limiting' => true
));

```
